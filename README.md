jquery-instant-webcam
=====================

A jquery plugin that uses a flash swf file for capturing images.

What am I gonna do?
--

Just download and look at the demo.. oh c'mon.. you're not a baby anymore

Any notes?
--

Uhh, yeah. You should run it in the server for it to run properly


How did you do it?
--

I used 'External Interface' to call methods from jQuery/javascript and 'Base64Encoder' to encode the data.

Can I decode it?
--
Of course! but I discourage it decoding in jQuery/javascript. It's fast if you decode it in the server

Any other methods?

>     webcam.getCameraList() //returns a string array of available cameras' names in your machine
